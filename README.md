Project: To Supply Leftover Food to Poor
About Project

Our project helps to reduce food waste and give food to poor people. Many hotels, mess, and functions have leftover food daily. Instead of throwing it, we collect that food and supply it to needy people.

How it works

Donors (hotels / events) inform leftover food

Volunteers go and collect the food

Volunteers deliver food to poor people safely

Why this project

Good food should not be wasted

Poor people should not stay hungry

Connecting both together will help society

What we aim

Make a simple system so leftover good food reaches poor people on time.
